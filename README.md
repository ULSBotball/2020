Programs for the 2020 Botball Season

Please add your programs to this repository as "Projects"

In order to keep everything organized, please title your programs using this naming pattern:

lego_INITIALS_nameofprogram.v_yyyymmdd
create_INITIALS_nameofprogram_yyyymmdd

A program name might be:

lego_JS_getbotguy.5_20200202

The date tells us when the program was last changed so that we know how new it is and can compare it to other versions.  Versions are indicated by the .v after the program name.  You should not write over your programs as you work on them, but create new versions each time.

The name of the program should say what it does:
getbotguy
driveupramp

etc.

no spaces are allowed in any program names
